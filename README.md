# Khipu 2025 Practicals (Coming soon!)

## Day 1 

| Topic ðŸ’¥ | Description ðŸ“˜ |
|:--- |----------------------------------------------------------|
[JAX, Optax, Haiku and CNN](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) | This tutorial covers the prerequisites for the rest of the practicals: JAX, Optax and Haiku are high performance libraries for computation, optimization and model learning. We then introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and show how to train a deep convolutional model using the aforementioned tools.  | 


## Day 2

| Topic ðŸ’¥ | Description ðŸ“˜ |
|:--- |----------------------------------------------------------|
| [Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2025/blob/main/notebooks/Graph_Neural_Networks.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2025/blob/main/notebooks/Graph_Neural_Networks.ipynb)<br /> <br />                                                           | In this tutorial, we will be learning about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a topic which has exploded in popularity in both research and industry. We will start with a refresher on graph theory, then dive into how GNNs work from a high level. Next we will cover some popular GNN implementations and see how they work in practice. |

## Day 3

| Topic ðŸ’¥ | Description ðŸ“˜ |
|:--- |----------------------------------------------------------|
[Intro to Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2025/blob/main/notebooks/reinforcement_learning.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2025/blob/main/notebooks/reinforcement_learning.ipynb) | In Reinforcement Learning (RL),  an _agent_ is trained to take the best actions in an environment so as to maximize a given reward in the long run. RL has seen tremendous success on a wide range of challenging problems such as learning to play complex video games like [Atari](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark), [StarCraft II](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) and [Dota II](https://openai.com/five/). In this introductory tutorial we will explore various RL approaches for solving the classic [CartPole](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/), an inverted pendulum system, where an agent must learn to balance a vertical pole by displacing the cart.|
