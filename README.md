[JAX, Optax, Haiku and CNN](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) | This tutorial covers the prerequisites for the rest of the practicals: JAX, Optax and Haiku are high performance libraries for computation, optimization and model learning. We then introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and show how to train a deep convolutional model using the aforementioned tools.  |
